# Project 1672

## Model Cocreation Framework

Inventory of required steps for users to participate in mapathons. 

### How to Mapathon

Preparation (internal):
  Teams
  - Participants should be divided into teams (how many should be in one team? around 5?)
  - Create a simple sign up sheet, where participants can choose their own teams
  Tasks
  - Decide on what tasks the participants should execute

Preparation (external):
  Send participants an email with some preparatory tasks:
    - Sign-up sheet for teams
    - GIS tutorial
    
Execution:
  Explain the goal of the mapathon
  Introduce participants to the set-up (i.e. SpatialChat)
  Give a short GIS tutorial
  Assign participants to tasks
 
 Wrap-Up
  Ask for feedback
  Show what has been achieved
  Explain what the next steps would be and how they could be involved further if the wanted to be

### Tutorial

To the point steps for users to get up to speed with the necessities of using the MCF. 

1. Install QGIS [Link](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)
We use QGIS to 
2. Download the [Project 1672](https//link_to_stuff) project file and double click *.map* file
3. Zoom to tutorial area
4. Make a basic edit (some info on how to edit)

### Tasks

List of tasks users can perform

-  **Add missing attributes** asdf
-  **Add a new feature** asdf
-  **Mofidy an existing feature** asdf
-  **Nominate feature for deletion** asdf

### Elements

The basic elements of a hydraulic model are 

-	Dikes: Used to block water
-	Waterways: Used to transport water
-	Structures: Used to manage water

These elements come in a few basic forms. Learn to recognize them on a map. Each element requires at least the following information:

- Type (see below)
- Source (wikipedia link, or other source material)
- Year (if known, approximate year it was )
- Discussion (link to github issue to discuss an element? E.g. discussion on whether the dike existed in 1672)
- Status (e.g. 0-claim, 1-under discussion, 2-closed)

#### Dikes

Types of dikes and how to recognize them:

1. River dikes: can be found next to rivers. Are usually > 5 m high. Defend against flooding
2. Embankment: small-scale feature < 1 m high. 


#### Waterways

Types of waterways and how to recognize them:

1. Canals (kanaal, wetering, etc.): man-made. Used for shipping by (small) boats. 
2. Ditches (sloten): man-made. used for water managament for agriculture
3. Rivers (rivieren, beken): natural. usually not straight


#### Structures

1. Sluice (sluis, inlaatwerk): part of a dike
2. Dam (dam): located in a waterway
